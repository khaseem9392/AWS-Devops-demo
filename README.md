- **VPC**: Contains public and private subnets, routing tables, and security groups.
- **EC2 Instance**: Hosts a sample Flask app running in a Docker container.
- **RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Managed relational database service.
- **CloudWatch**: Collects application and infrastructure logs and metrics.
- **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**: Automates infrastructure provisioning and app deployment.
- **IAM Roles**: Ensures least-privilege security access.

## ‚úÖ Tech Stack Justification

| Tool | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **Terraform** | Declarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows version control, reproducibility, and modular infrastructure provisioning. |
| **GitHub Actions** | Native CI/CD integration with GitHub to automate infrastructure provisioning, app builds, and deployments in a secure, auditable way. |
| **Docker** | Ensures containerized, consistent app deployment across environments (dev/staging/prod). Simple portability and isolation. |
| **CloudWatch** | Provides central logging and metrics for both EC2 and RDS instances, aiding in debugging and monitoring system health. |
| **IAM Roles** | Secure authentication without hardcoded secrets by using roles with minimum permissions assigned to EC2/RDS services. |

# AWS DevOps Demo Project - Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Step 1 ‚Äì Prerequisites Installation

### Install VS Code  
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Install Required VS Code Extensions  
- Terraform by HashiCorp  
- Docker  
- Python  

### Install Tools Locally  
- Terraform CLI  
- AWS CLI  
- Docker Desktop  

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2 ‚Äì Configure AWS CLI Credentials

```bash
aws configure
Input:

AWS Access Key ID

AWS Secret Access Key

Default region: us-east-1

Output format: json

‚úÖ Step 3 ‚Äì Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-devops-demo.git
cd aws-devops-demo
‚úÖ Step 4 ‚Äì Terraform Initialization
bash
Copy code
cd iac/environments/dev
terraform init
Expected Output:

nginx
Copy code
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
‚úÖ Step 5 ‚Äì Apply Terraform Configuration
bash
Copy code
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars" -auto-approve
Expected Outputs Example:

makefile
Copy code
Apply complete! Resources: 5 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:
ec2_ip = "3.122.45.67"
rds_endpoint = "mydb.abcd1234.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432"
vpc_id = "vpc-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890"
‚úÖ Step 6 ‚Äì Build and Run Sample App Locally (Optional)
Navigate to Sample App
bash
Copy code
cd app/sample-app
Build Docker Image
bash
Copy code
docker build -t sample-app:latest .
Run the Container
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 80:80 sample-app
Test Locally
Open browser or run:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost
Expected Response:

csharp
Copy code
Hello from Sample App running on EC2!
‚úÖ Step 7 ‚Äì Access App on Deployed EC2
Retrieve Public IP from Terraform output:

bash
Copy code
terraform output ec2_ip
Access in browser:

cpp
Copy code
http://<ec2_ip>
Expected Response:

csharp
Copy code
Hello from Sample App running on EC2!
‚úÖ Step 8 ‚Äì Monitoring Logs
Log in to AWS Console

Navigate to CloudWatch ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Log Groups ‚Üí /aws/sample-app

View logs from EC2 and RDS

‚úÖ Step 9 ‚Äì CI/CD Automation
After pushing to the GitHub repo:

GitHub Actions workflow auto-applies Terraform

Builds and deploys the Docker sample app

Example workflow file:

bash
Copy code
pipeline/github-actions.yml

## üìä Monitoring & Logging
- Logs are available in **AWS CloudWatch**:
    - **EC2 Logs** ‚Üí `/aws/sample-app`
    - **RDS Logs** ‚Üí Automatic PostgreSQL logs
- CloudWatch Alarms can be added for CPU thresholds or failed logins (optional).

---

## üåü Bonus Features

- ‚úÖ **Auto-scaling Group**: EC2 instances automatically scale based on CPU utilization thresholds.
- ‚úÖ **Canary Deployment**: Implemented in the GitHub Actions pipeline for gradual rollout of app versions.

---

## ‚úÖ Security Best Practices
- Use of IAM roles assigned to EC2 and RDS resources.
- No hardcoded AWS credentials in the Terraform code.
- Secrets (like DB passwords) passed via Terraform variables and stored securely (in practice: AWS Secrets Manager).

## üìÇ Example Outputs

```bash
ec2_ip = "3.122.45.67"
rds_endpoint = "mydb.abcd1234.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432"
vpc_id = "vpc-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890"
```
